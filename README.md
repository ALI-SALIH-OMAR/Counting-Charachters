# Counting-Charachters
a MIPS assembly language program to count each letter, digit, special character, and number of lines in a text file.
Open a text file "input.txt" and read all characters into an array in memory.
If the file does not exist then the program should display an error message and terminates.

Traverse the array character by character. Count all letters, digits, and all other special
characters. In addition, count the lines (A line ends with a '\nâ€™ character). A single-letter/word
line is also counted. Does not distinguish between capital and lowercase letter.

Then display the total count of letters, digits, special characters, and lines.
